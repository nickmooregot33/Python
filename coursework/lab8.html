<h1 id="lab-8-processing-and-visualizing-data">Lab 8: Processing and Visualizing Data</h1>
<h2 id="accessing-web-data-with-requests">Accessing Web Data with <code>requests</code></h2>
<p>Oftentimes the data we wish to access are only available remotely. As a straightforward extension of working with file data on our local file system, we can also work with documents hosted on the World Wide Web using the <code>requests</code> library<sup>[<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">docs</a>]</sup>. While accessing and manipulating Web data can be <em>extremely</em> involved, we are only going to access plain-text files hosted remotely; things will look much like they do for you when you access a file.</p>
<p><code>requests</code> simply accesses a remote object by its URL, the address you would type into your browser to access it:</p>
<pre><code>import requests
book = requests.get(&#39;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11302/pg11302.txt&#39;)
print book.text</code></pre>
<p>The entire text file stored at that URL is now available to you in <code>book</code>. But more information is also available, such as the URL the text was retrieved from</p>
<pre><code>print book.url</code></pre>
<p>and the time it took to retrieve the data (in seconds):</p>
<pre><code>print book.elapsed</code></pre>
<p>We won't care about anything but the raw data, the text, right now however.</p>
<p>Recall the language frequency exercise from last week. You should retrieve that file from your <code>lab7</code> directory and copy it to your <code>lab8</code> directory. At the command line (NOT the Python interpreter—the symbol should be <code>$</code> not <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>), you may type the following (if you are in <code>lab8</code>):</p>
<pre><code>cp ../lab7/frequency.py .
cp -r ../lab7/lang .</code></pre>
<p>or, if you are more comfortable using the Navigator, you may do this using the Linux graphical interface. Your TA or possibly a classmate can demonstrate this to you. If you did <em>not</em> get <code>frequency.py</code> working correctly, you may download a copy of a working script <a href="./data/frequency.py">here</a>.</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>With this, determine the likely language of the text from the URL above:</p>
<pre><code>for language in L.keys():
    freq = calcFreq(book.text)
    f = calcMatch(freq, L[language])
    print &#39;%s, %s&#39;%(language, f)</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the value of <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> for a specific English dictionary as compared to the reference English letter frequency? You should use the English dictionary available online at <code>https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29765/pg29765.txt</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="accessing-formatted-data">Accessing Formatted Data</h2>
<p>We would also frequently like to parse data into other formats than a string when we import a file. A common way of storing data as a table (like in Microsoft Excel) is as a <em>comma-separated value</em> file, or <code>csv</code>. While specialized tools exist (such as a <code>csv</code> module or tools in <code>numpy</code>), we would like you to understand the root of what these tools do before introducing them. (Ryan demonstrated the use of <code>csv.DictReader</code> in class last Wednesday.)</p>
<p>To see the format of a <code>csv</code> file, you can take a look at the plain text of <code>surface.csv</code>, which describes the positions (in <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>, <span class="math"><em>z</em></span> coördinates) of uranium atoms on a surface and an oxygen atom adsorbing onto the surface. The first three lines read:</p>
<pre><code>92,0,0,0
92,0,0,-0.09502
92,0.25,0.25,-0.04751</code></pre>
<p>These represent the uranium atom (atomic weight 92) and the coördinates of each atom.</p>
<p>You can read this file in using the <code>split</code> method to turn it into a collection of lists:</p>
<pre><code>data = []
with open(&#39;surface.csv&#39;) as dataFile:
    for line in dataFile.readlines():
        line = line.split(&#39;,&#39;)
        data.append(line)

print data</code></pre>
<p>The problem now is that our imported data are strings instead of floats. In order to fix this, we need to cycle through our list of lists in a nested <code>enumerate</code> pair of loops.</p>
<pre><code>for row_index, row in enumerate(data):
    for col_index, item in enumerate(row):
        data[row_index][col_index] = float(item)</code></pre>
<p>(Please take a moment to understand this code and what <code>row_index</code>, <code>row</code>, <code>col_index</code>, and <code>item</code> represent. Insert <code>print</code> statements if necessary.)</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the file <code>data.py</code> and compose a function <code>s2f</code> (for string-to-float). <code>s2f</code> should expect a list of lists of strings as a parameter and <code>return</code>s a list of lists of floats instead. Answer this question with <code>data.py:s2f</code>. You may test your data on <code>surface.csv</code> (after clearing <code>data</code>, of course, to prevent using already-converted data). This is the sort of function (like <code>p2f</code> in the last lab) that may be worth keeping around after your tenure in CS 101.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>☞<em>Aside</em>: Clearly strings like <code>'hackeysack'</code> do not map to <code>float</code>s. What should we do in that case? Our options are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>supply the value <code>None</code></li>
<li>supply the value <code>0.0</code></li>
<li><em>throw</em> an <em>exception</em></li>
</ul>
In this latter case, what we can do is make our function return an error instead of completing its task, much like <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>. Although we won't go into exception and error handling in CS 101, this is an extremely useful way to deal with nonstandard input to functions<sup>[<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions">PythonWiki</a>]</sup>.

<h2 id="visualizing-data-with-matplotlib">Visualizing Data with MatPlotLib</h2>
<p>In the 1600s, René Descartes innovated mathematics by introducing a connection between <em>geometry</em> (the art of drawing lines and curves) and <em>algebra</em> (the art of manipulating equations and unknown variables). This became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"><em>Cartesian coordinate system</em></a>, and provided a systematic way to show the relationship between the set of numbers given to a function as <em>input</em> and the set of numbers obtained from a function as <em>output</em>. (Remember our lesson on functions!)</p>
<p>Thus, a simple graphical way to show this relationship is to plot our inputs along the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> axis and our outputs along the <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> axis: you should be quite familiar with plotting by this point in your schooling. In order to plot on a computer screen, we require a way to tell Python to tell the operating system what to draw, and that way is MatPlotLib (henceforth MPL). With MPL you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>visualize plots in two and three dimensions</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="./img/drum-animate.gif" width="50%" />

</div></li>
<li><p>produce publication-quality graphics</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="./img/bessel.png" width="75%" />

</div></li>
<li><p>and visualize your data sets to discover features and trends.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="./img/gaussian.png" width="50%" />

</div></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the main reason we haven't done more with graphics to date is that you have only just started to learn how to generate enough data to be worth visualizing. That will all change as we move into the modeling and simulation segment of the course.</p>
<p>Properly speaking, MPL is a collection of related plotting tools. We are interested in using PyPlot, which lets you specify the data attached to a figure and how they are to be represented. Since it's rather painful to type <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> over and over, we'll <em>alias</em> the submodule as <code>plt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</code></pre>
<p>which allows us to refer to <code>plt</code> instead throughout.</p>
<p>Let's visualize a simple data set. Enter these lines one at a time to see their effect.</p>
<pre><code>x = range(10)
y = [2,5,3,8,6,4,7,2,4,1]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p>In particular, note that the plot does not appear until you explicitly tell MPL to show it. And while this figure window is open, try to type something in the Python interpreter. You'll find that you cannot execute anything—Python is paused waiting for you to do something with the plot before it can proceed.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>Save</code> <img src="./img/icon-mpl-save.png" width="22px;"/> the plot as <code>figure_4.png</code> (the question number) in your <code>lab8</code> directory. Close the figure window and Python again displays the input prompt <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, every time you produce a plot, at least three steps are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating the data for the plot.</li>
<li>Creating the plot itself and adding the data to it.</li>
<li>Displaying the plot to the user (or saving it directly to disk).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simple-line-plots">Simple Line Plots</h3>
<p>Let's do some more interesting plots than that. In all cases, we will specify the range and number of data points to plot (the <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> values) as well as the corresponding function to generate the <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> values. You should save each plot in the format <code>figure_#.png</code>, where <code>#</code> should be replaced with the question number and answer the question with the image file name (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>figure_#.png</code>).</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Plot <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em></span> for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0, 1]</span> with five equally-spaced data points. (That is, for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0, 1]</span> with five data points. Since we haven't covered how to perform array operations yet, you'll have to calculate these one at a time. A simple <code>for</code> loop could do the trick (after defining <code>x</code>, of course):</p>
<pre><code>y = []
for x_val in x:
    y.append(x_val ** 2)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Plot <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − <em>x</em></span> for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0, 1]</span> with five data points. Save it as discussed above.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0, 1]</span> with five data points. Save it.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 2 * <em>x</em> − 1</span> for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0, 1]</span> with five data points. Save it.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = sin(<em>x</em>)<sup>2</sup></span> for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [ − 1, 1]</span> with nine data points. Save it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The previous group of plots looked rather repetitive, didn't it? Let's try adding some color and varying the line appearance for each function in the plot. Tell Python the following:</p>
<pre><code>x = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,  2.5,  3.0]
y = [1.0, 1.6, 2.7, 4.5, 7.4, 12.2, 20.1]
plt.plot(x, y, &#39;r--&#39;)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p>This time, you see a red dashed plot displayed to you:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="./img/exp-red-dashed.png" width="50%" />

</div>
<p>The third element, <code>'r--'</code>, is known as a <em>format string</em>. Essentially, you've listed a line color (<code>r</code> for red) and a line style (<code>--</code> for dashed), which MPL then interprets to produce the plot above.</p>
<p>Many other options are available for both color (the first part) and marker (the second part). Play around with a few combinations of these; more information is available in the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot">MPL documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Now you can combine these effects to produce plots with multiple functions depicted.</p>
<pre><code>x = range(-5,6)
y1 = [25,16,9,4,1,0,1,4,9,16,25]
y2 = [-12.5,-6.4,-2.7,-0.8,-0.1,0,0.1,0.8,2.7,6.4,12.5]
plt.plot(x, y1, &#39;g:&#39;, x, y2, &#39;co&#39;)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p>It may be clearer to write it thus:</p>
<pre><code>plt.plot(x, y1, &#39;g:&#39;,
         x, y2, &#39;co&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>(We prefer to do it this way—it makes it easier to read and edit. Note that Python is being reasonably accommodating about line breaks and indentation in this case.)</p>
<pre><code>from math import cos, exp, pi
x = []
for x_val in range(10000):
    x.append(x_val/10000.0)

y = []
for y_val in range(10000):
    y.append(cos(pi/(y_val/1e5+1e-10)) * exp(-2*y_val/1e5)) # prevent div by zero

plt.plot(x, y, &#39;b-&#39;)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-plots">Other Plots</h2>
<p>Many other plot types are available to you with MPL. A few of the more useful ones (don't forget to save these as before):</p>
